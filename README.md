# Risk-Assessment-Tool
Final Year Project GitHub code repository of Eimhin Lane.

This project entails a risk assessment questionairre that will count which of four risk categories you fall under most.
These categories are worm,trojan,sqli and ransomware attacks.
Additional program attempts made over the course of development are kept seperate in another folder from the main project.
To start have all the code in one directory, use cmd to view that directory and type "RiskAssessmentTool.py" to run the program.
You need to install Python, PIL and Tkinter if you don't have them already.

Thank you for reading, have fun.
